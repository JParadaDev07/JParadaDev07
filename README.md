My name is Julian and I'm a small Colombian Backend programmer, focused on developing small services and other dynamics.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently looking to improve my skills as a programmer, although I am still a trainee, I know I will get better, we all start with something!

- ðŸŒ± I don't just want to settle for being a BackEnd developer, I want to be a Fullstack developer someday, so I'm slowly learning how to be one.

- ðŸ‘¯ For now, I'm looking to collaborate as a BackEnd developer, implementing services or creating them, I like to push myself!

- ðŸ¤” For now, being a Junior, I would like support in order to improve as a programmer, I am too curious and I like to learn!

- ðŸ“« If you want to reach me, you can do it throught my personal email: alexgualteros02@gmail.com
